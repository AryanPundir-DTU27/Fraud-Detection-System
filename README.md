🔍 Project Overview
This end-to-end fraud detection case study simulates a real-world data science and analytics pipeline. It demonstrates how structured data can be transformed into actionable insights through a blend of SQL-based data engineering, machine learning classification models, and business intelligence visualization.

The goal is to identify patterns of fraudulent behavior within a financial transactions dataset and build a foundation for proactive fraud prevention systems.

🔧 Part 1: SQL-Based EDA & Data Preparation
Tools: MySQL, SQL scripts

✅ Key Steps:
Created and used a dedicated schema: frauds

Defined transactional data schema including user details, transaction types, timestamps, and behavioral metadata

Used LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE to import a CSV dataset into a MySQL table

Cleaned data by trimming whitespace, filling blanks, correcting types (e.g. converting decimal to integers)

Built a staging table to isolate and standardize usable data for modeling

Identified common fraud-inducing features like:

High-frequency users
Specific devices and locations
Time-of-day spikes
Past fraud history
📊 SQL EDA Highlights:
Total transactions vs. fraudulent transactions
Fraud rate by device, location, transaction type
Patterns by hour of day and payment method
Fraud risk distribution by previous behavior and account age
High-risk user-location-device combinations
📂 See scripts: sql_eda/FraudDetectionCleaning.sql and sql_eda/FraudDetectionEDA.sql

📊 Part 2: Tableau Dashboard
Tools: Tableau Public / Desktop

🎨 Dashboards Include:
Fraud percentage by device and payment method
Heatmap of fraudulent transactions across hours
User behavior dashboard with filters on previous fraud count
Location-wise fraud concentration
🧠 Design Goals:
Non-technical stakeholder readability
Highlight red flags visually
Enable drill-downs (e.g., by user, device, time)
📸 Screenshots available in /visualization/tableau_screenshots/

You can open dashboard.twb using Tableau Desktop or Public.

🤖 Part 3: Machine Learning Classification
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

⚙️ Steps Covered:
Loaded the cleaned dataset into a pandas dataframe

Feature engineered new predictors based on SQL insights:

Number of transactions in last 24H
Bucketed transaction amount
Device type and account age group
Split data into training and test sets (80/20)

Trained a Logistic Regression model as a baseline

Evaluated performance using:

Confusion matrix
Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
Fraud detection recall: Key for minimizing false negatives
Discussed potential improvements (Random Forests, SMOTE, etc.)

📓 Notebook: ml_notebook/Fraud_Detection_Personalized_Modeling.ipynb

✅ Results Summary
Metric	Value (Example Only)
Accuracy	92.3%
Precision	84.7%
Recall (Fraud Class)	76.5%
F1 Score	80.3%
Note: Results depend on class balance and features. Custom thresholds can improve recall.

📌 Dataset Source
The dataset was sourced from a public Kaggle competition:

https://www.kaggle.com (Anonymized financial fraud dataset)

It was cleaned and extended with SQL-based staging and standardized for analysis.

💡 Key Learnings & Reflection
SQL is extremely powerful for preparing and understanding transactional data
Tableau helps communicate fraud insights across business units
Even simple ML models, when based on rich features, can perform well
Structuring a project into modular, reusable parts improves maintainability and storytelling
